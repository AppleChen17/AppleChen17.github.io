      <p>
        This is a class project. Based on the basic game rule of monopoly, this
        project add more features on it to make it more interesting. For
        example, our group member create our own unique monopoly map related to
        "programming language".We also implemented the feature of able to choose
        how many people could play together in a round and user could enter
        their name (it is fine to enter same name or choosing same character since
        the way to store the player is according to the order of choosing).
        Besides, there is also "characters" exist in our game, which have
        different abilities that could be triggered while playing. We also
        maintain the "community chest card" in this game, there are some
        different events and corresponding effects happened. Furthermore, Our
        group member combine the Tower Defense Game in the "Gambling" part,
        making the monopoly more interesting.
